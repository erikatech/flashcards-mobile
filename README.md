# Flashcards Mobile Project

This is the final project of final module on Udacity's React course, that deals with React Native
The flashcards is a hybrid app that runs both on Android and iOS devices. It allows the user to study through a flashcards collection.
Within the app, the users can create different categories of flashcards called Decks. Inside the decks, the users can add the cards and participate on quizes 
inside those decks.

To get this application running you should do the following:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start with `yarn start` and choose to run in one of the devices that you have available (a for Android and i for Ios)

## What You're Getting

* the possibility to create decks
* you can list all the decks 
* you can select one of your decks, and after that you can freely create your cards inside this deck
* with your cards created, you can join your quizes to check if you're dominating the card subject.

Feel free to contribute.
